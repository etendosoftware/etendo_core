<!--
     This file configures the OBProvider ServiceLocator/Factory to
     use specific classes at runtime to implement certain functionality.

     Each runtime class is configured using a bean tag. The bean tag
     contains the name of the bean, the runtime class which should be
     used and if the bean is a singleton or not.
     The bean name is often equal to the name of the standard OpenBravo
     class which is replaced by the bean configured here.
